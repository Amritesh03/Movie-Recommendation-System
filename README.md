🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and machine learning techniques. It suggests movies to users based on similarities in movie metadata such as genres, cast, crew, and storyline.

🚀 Features

• Recommend top similar movies for a given movie.
• Uses cosine similarity for recommendation.
• Fetches movie posters dynamically using TMDb API.
• Interactive Streamlit web application for easy use.

🛠️ Tech Stack

• Python (Data processing and backend)
• Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pickle, requests
• Web App: Streamlit
• API: The Movie Database (TMDb) API

⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie_Recommendation_System.git
cd Movie_Recommendation_System

2. Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

🎥 Usage

• Enter/select a movie in the app.
• Get top 5 recommended movies with posters.
• Explore visually appealing recommendations.

📊 Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
   • Clean and merge datasets.
   • Extract features like genre, keywords, cast, crew.
   • Convert text to vectors using CountVectorizer.

2. Similarity Calculation
   • Use cosine similarity to measure closeness between movies.

3. Deployment
   • Save processed data (movies.pkl) and similarity matrix (similarity.pkl) for fast recommendations.
   • Build an interactive UI with Streamlit.

🔑 API Key

To fetch posters from TMDb:
   • Create an account on TMDb
   • Generate an API key.
   • Replace the API key inside app.py.

📌 Example

If you search for Inception, recommendations may include:
   • Interstellar
   • The Dark Knight
   • Shutter Island
   • The Prestige
   • Memento
